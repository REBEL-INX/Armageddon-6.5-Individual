# Armageddon-6.5-Individual

## Task 2:

Identify and address the three most pressing pain points in your opinion, and write out a two paragraph solution to mitigate or solve each issue. Make sure to include the problems with the current configuration, how your suggestions improve on the current configuration, potential drawbacks to your new configuration, and whether your suggestion is a net positive towards accomplishing Balerica Inc.'s goals.

## Response

The three biggest issues with the current network architecture and tech stack of Balerica Inc is the use of click ops, CMD scripts, and a lack of a central codebase. The issues that these introduce into the current workflow are as follows: One, using click ops increases the risk of misconfiguration and wastes time. Two, using a CMD scripts runs the risk of deploying a faulty application that isn't scalable, managed from a centralized location, and can be improperly built and configured. Three, not using a centralized codebase is unorganized and can introduce unnecessary differences into each environment. My idea for a new network architecture aims to solve the three issues by implementing the use of a Google Cloud Platform's virtual private cloud and Google Compute Engine to handle the admin workload, with regional managed instance groups and virtual machines to deploy the applications, and the use of a central code repository that houses the infrastructure for testing, updates, and production environments. By utilizing these outlined processes, Balerica Inc will be able to scale their admin operations as well as their global footprint, allowing for the testing centers to maintain their current operations and handle a growing workload.

The first order of business is to develop the code for the virtual private cloud and google compute engines that will be the HQ Admin of Balerica Inc in Brazil. The main company infrastructure will be housed in this region and will handle the communication across the network between the different testing centers and HQ, as well as the communication between the testing center applications and the testing sessions. All changes to the managed instance groups will be approved and validated by HQ Admin and pushed from dev, test and into production. In addition the HQ Admin will utilize the current use of on-prem backups and Google Storage Transfer to synchronize back ups between the cloud for record keeping and ease of access. From there, the testing centers in the USA, Japan and Thailand/Philippines regions will be divided into their respective subnets where they will be in charge of handling their managed instance groups to optimize efficiency. This will provide a usable instance template, auto-scaling and auto healing so that each region has a consistent environment to manage with multi-zone deployments ensuring high availability when multiple tests are being proctored. Lastly, the network architecture will be housed within a centralized code repository encompassing the virtual private cloud architecture and the instance templates for the managed instance groups. As mentioned previously, each managed instance group will have dev, test, and production repo that is monitored by HQ Admin for an vulnerabilities where secure access will be maintained and monitored between the testing center applications and the testing sessions browser.

One drawback to utilizing this style of network architecture is that there will need to be a secure way for the subnets in each region to communicate between them selves and the public internet for the proctored tests. That can either be done with a Google Cloud Platform High Availability VPN or it can be done within the network connectivity center. Whichever one is used will need extra consideration so that the subnets don't overlap and communication can be constant and secure all while accounting for future growth of Balerica Inc. Another issue is that there is a quota on the amount of managed instance groups that can be created within a project, zone, and globally in Google Cloud Platform. This means that there may be additional communication between Balerica Inc and Google Cloud Platform to request an increase to the quota so that there isn't a stop in service. The drawbacks to using a centralize code repository is that in needs to be located somewhere. If it is located on-prem, then there needs to be connections established and maintained between the subnets utilizing it so that changes aren't pushed without authorization. If it is located on the cloud there is an added security that is needed so that the code isn't available on the public internet and that access is only permitted to those who need it. Similarly, if the back-ups for the code is stored on-prem than the space needs to be managed to reduce failover and if the back ups are synchronized with the cloud than a retention policy needs to be established in accordance with operation laws ands standards.
